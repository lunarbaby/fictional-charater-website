# :sweat: Code Bootcamp Week One Assignment
## Make a website for a fictional character

This is my first assignment for my web development bootcamp. The purpose of this is assignment is to use CSS and HTML to design a website. I made this website about one of my favorite characters Dilbert. I used basic HTML and CSS to make this website. I also learn how to install Git and I learn the basics of using Github.
