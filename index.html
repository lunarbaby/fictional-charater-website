            <h2 id="About">About me</h2>
                <p>I am a 34 year old with a rare medical condition which is characterized by an extreme intuition about all things mechanical and electrical and utter social ineptitude. I am a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I currently work as a electrical engineer at Path-E-Tech. I have several years of experience working at my job but I often find myself in bizarre situations. I like to consider myself a problem solver and a optimis.  I spend my free time playing with computers and technology. I also like to go on dates but my dates always go wrong.

                <h3>Dogbert</h3>
                    <p>Dogbert is my talking pet dog. Dogbert is a megalomaniac and has taken over the world several time. Once he becomes the leader of the world, he always quits for a variety of reasons. While Dogbert has no love of humanity, he has alway been there for me and seems to have a little respect for me. He often has no problems playing jokes on me or even being mean to me, however. Dogbert has many ventures in the business world including a consultant, tech support, modeling, ect.</p>

                <h3>Ratbert</h3>
                    <p>Ratbert is my talking pet rat. He was originally was a lab rat (Ratbert was know as XP-39C2) but he escaped after being subject to a lab scientist’s cruel experiments and found refuge in my home. I must admit that I was not accepting of him at first due to my prejudice against rats but I eventually allowed him to stay in my home. Ratbert is a simple rat and therefore is very gullible and innocent, although optimistic (like me). He has worked as an intern, a concierge, a consultant, vice-president of marketing, and CEO. Despite all this his biggest ambition is to become loved and accepted. He is always trying to impress those around him to whom he considers friends but almost always fails. Ratbert is friendly with Bob the dinosaur and the garbage man.

                <h3>My mother</h3>
                    <p>RMy mother is a homely and intelligent woman. She is selfish, often forget what I do at my job or what is going on in my life and openly acts uncaring towards me. She however does love me. My mother and I often get out of seeing each other. She has nearly the same level of technical knowledge as me but often has me do the technical work for her. She is obsessed with saving money and Scrabble (which she has been accused of cheating). She is very close to Dogbert.</p>

                <h3>Father</h3>
                    <p>I know basically nothing of my father and only have surveillance video of him (but no pictures). He has been missing for years, at a 24-hour “All-you-can-eat” restaurant at the local mall.

                <img src="pictures/Wally.png" alt="Wally" width="75" class="center">
                <h3>Wally</h3>
                    <p>Wally is one of my co-worker at work. The best description of Wally is a shell of a long gone great programmer. However, Wally describes himself as the outcome of thousands of generations of selective breeding, designed to produce no biometric impression: no pulse, no fingerprints, no DNA. He is often seen drinking many cups of coffee a day and is almost never seen without a coffee cup in hand. Wally always goes out of his way to avoids all situations in which he has to work and when assigned tasks he does everything to stall or delay or pass the work to someone else. Wally enjoys annoying others by asking frivolous questions during budget request, disregarding rules, loitering around others’ cubicles and turing his own cubicle into a swimming pool. His apathetic and unmotivated personality is so bad that his mere presence is enough to suck the optimism and hope from others. Despite this he is the highest paid employee at the company.

                <h3>Asok</h3>
                    <p>Asok is our department intern and a graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology. He has served many years as an intern but despite his brilliance and ability to solve difficult problems in a few keystrokes, he is still naive to the cruelties and politics of the business world. Due to this, Asok is often the scapegoat for the antics of other co-workers, and has been denied permission to be a regular employee and the usage of company resources. Currently, Asok works in a storage facility but used to work in the handicapped stall of the office bathroom. Asok is trained to only sleep on national holidays and telekinesis at his alma mater.</p>

                    <p>Loud Howard is another person I work with. He is incapable of speaking quietly due to living near the airport. In fact, his voice can shatter glass and can breaks other people’s eardrums. So, it is easy to say that he is very hard to work with.</p>

His is known for his micromanagement, gross incompetence, obliviousness to his surroundings, and unhelpful buzzword usage but he has not been fired. PHB is childish, immature, ignorant, and rude, while also being annoyingly cheerful and oblivious to his own actions. He is the bane of my existence.</p>
