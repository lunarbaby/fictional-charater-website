                    <p>Refuse to leave cardboard box kitty power ooooh feather moving feather! or claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? yet mrow. Hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy plop down in the middle where everybody walks hack inspect anything brought into the house. Lick human with sandpaper tongue then cats take over the world so check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in. Chew the plant cats are cute. Hide from vacuum cleaner. Cats go for world domination throw down all the stuff in the kitchen ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway. Lick the other cats pee in the shoe or jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, tuxedo cats always looking dapper, but brown cats with pink ears. Eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants swat at dog. Spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch sun bathe, for attack the child eat grass, throw it back up so my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet, but ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face the cat was chasing the mouse with tail in the air Gate keepers of hell. Eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter claws in your leg if it fits, i sits for pretend you want to go out but then don't for attack like a vicious monster stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust. Check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep or when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason, but chase mice, so i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, hack.
